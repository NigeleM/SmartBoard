# SmartBoard
SmartBoard Application that attempts to be a better clipboard.

# Problem
Imagine being on a website and needing to copy several things from the page.
You don't want to copy the entire page and you want to be selective.
You don't want to go back and forth copying and pasting from the website to a document.


# Solution
Create a clipboard that can hold multiple and different copy's.
You can then select the different copy's from the clipboard out of order 
because it has a history of your copy's
and paste them to your document. Saving you alot of time going back and forth on documents.
